## (Re)building a Faster, Better Slack - [Samantha Siow](https://github.com/samanthasiow)

> A new version of Slack is rolling out for our desktop customers, built from the ground up to be faster, more efficient, and easier to work on. In this talk, Iâ€™ll focus on our move from an eager data model to a lazily loaded and incomplete data model, and how that made for a speedier Slack experience.

Modern Architecture - Slack
* All UI components built in React
* Single process for multiple workspaces
* Lazily-loaded & incomplete data model


Modern app loads 33% faster


How they improved Slack:

* Load less code upfront
  * Used service worker to cache assets
  * Client-side rendering
* Declutter your boot data
* Prioritize initial API calls
